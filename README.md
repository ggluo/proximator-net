# proximator-net

## TODO List for journal submission

1. [ ] retrospective experitment
    * modl
    * varational
    * ethz vae
    * bm3d
2. [ ] prospective experitment
    * grappa
    * compressed sensing
3. [ ] convergence curve
4. [ ] analyze the parameter lamba that is the weight for learnt regularization term
5. [ ] To improve metrics, try different network structure, such as replacing dncnn with unet, adding kernel method layer or add self-attention layer.
6. [ ] organize codes
7. [ ] training the model with fastMRI dataset
8. [ ] look into  the step of iteration

# By Mar 11
1. [ ] fix the proximator
2. [ ] redesign the structure of network, increase number of layers, use self-attention
3. [ ] rerun the metrics
4. [ ] prepare modl, varnet vae
